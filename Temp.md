### Impact factor

The impact factor (IF) or journal impact factor (JIF) of an academic journal is a scientometric index calculated by Clarivate that reflects the yearly mean number of citations of articles published in the last two years in a given journal

#### Formular

y = year

$$
{IF}_y = \frac{{Citations}_y}{Publications_{y-1} + {Publications_{y-2}}}

### Soft computing

Soft computing is a set of algorithms, including neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms.These algorithms are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. It is contrasted with hard computing: algorithms which finds provably correct and optimal solutions to problems.
